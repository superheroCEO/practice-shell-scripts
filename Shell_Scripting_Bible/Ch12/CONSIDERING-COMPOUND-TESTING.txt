The if-then statement allows you to use BOOLEAN LOGIC to COMBINE tests. You can use these two Boolean operators:

  [ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ] 
  
  [ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]


The first Boolean operation uses the AND Boolean operator to COMBINE TWO CONDITIONS. BOTH CONDITIONS MUST BE MET
for the then section to execute.

**Note: Boolean logic is a method that reduces the potential returned values to be either TRUE or FALSE **

The second Boolean operation uses the OR Boolean operator to COMBINE TWO CONDITIONS. If EITHER condition evalutes
to a TRUE condition, the then section is executed.
