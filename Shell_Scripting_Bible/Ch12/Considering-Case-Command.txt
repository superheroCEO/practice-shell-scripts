Often you'll find yourself trying to eval. a var's value, looking for a spec. value w/i a set of possible values.

The  elif  statements continue the if-then chekcing, LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC VALUE for the single comparison variable.

INSTEAD of having to write all the  elif  statements to continue CHECKING THE SAME VARIABLE VALUE, you can:
  use the   case  command 

The  case  command checks MULTIPLE VALUES of a single variable in a LIST-ORIENTED FORMAT:

  case variable in
  pattern1 | pattern2) commands1;;
  pattern3) commands2;;
  *) default commands;;
  esac

The  case  cmd COMPARES THE VARIABLE SPECIFIED AGAINST THE DIFFERENT PATTERNS.

IF the var matches the pattern, the shell exec. the cmds specified for the pattern.

You can list more than pattern on a line, using the | operator to separate each pattern.

The (  *  ) symbol is the CATCH-ALL for valeus that don't match ANY of the listed patterns.
