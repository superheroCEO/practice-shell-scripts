recall: the if statement line is just a normal shell command

Q: Does Bash  if-then  statement have the ability to evalute any condition otehr than a command's exit status code?


A:	NO


Enter the  test  command. 

test command provides way to test different conditions in an  if-then  statement. 

IF the condition listed in the  test  command evaluates to TRUE, the  test cmd  EXITS WITH A 0 EXIT STATUS CODE.

IF the condition listed in the  test  cmd evalutes to FALSE, the  test  cmd exits w/a NON-ZERO EXIT STATUS CODE  ("1" for simplicty) ==> causes the  if-then  statement to exit.

format:		test CONDITION

- condition is a series of parameters & values that the  test  cmd evaluates. Looks like this:


if test CONDITION
then
  command(s)
fi


- if you leave out the condition portion of  test  cmd statement, it exitsw/a NON-ZERO EXIT STATUS CODE & triggers any ELSE block statement(s).
