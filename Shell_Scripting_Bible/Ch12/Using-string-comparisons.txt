Test conditions DO allow you perform comparisons on string values, but it can get tricky, so be fucking careful. Look at this table:

Comparison		Description
str1 = str2		checks IF str1 is THE SAME AS str2
str1 != str2		checks IF str1 is NOT THE SAME AS str2
str1 < str2		checks IF str1 is LESS THAN str2
str1 > str2		checks IF str1 is GREATER THAN str2
-n str1			checks IF str1 has a LENGTH greater than 0
-z str1			checks IF str1 has A LENGHT OF 0 [ is it 0?]

keep in mind, using the NOT EQUALS str comparison (!=) allows you to deteremine IF 2 strings have the same value or not
