The UNTIL command works exactly THE OPPOSITE WAY from the while command. The until command rq that you specify a test command that normally prodces a NON-ZERO EXIT STATUS. 

As long as the exit status of the test command is NON-ZERO, the bash shell executes the commands listed in the loop. 

WHEN the test command returns a 0 exit status, the LOOP STOPS.

THE UNTIL COMMAND FORMAT:

until test command(s)
do
  other commands
done



Similar to the while command, you can have more than one test command in the until command statement. 

ONLY the EXIT STATUS of the LAST command determines if the bash shell executes the OTHER COMMANDS defined.
